# citrus-code-editor

<img src="https://github.com/simcard0000/citrus-code-editor/blob/master/CitrusCodeEditor/src/application/citrus%20logo.png" width = 300>

citrus is a simple code editor designed for small edits and making notes. As it is a personal project, it is also serving as a way to test a language I am creating, called Lemonade. 

### To-Do:
- [ ] finish UI appearance
- [ ] fix journal printing capabilities
- [ ] implement syntax highlighting
- [ ] interpret Lemonade within the app
- [X] make UI parts dynamic when resizing

### Credits
The "logo" for this project was made in Microsoft Word by drawing shapes. The font used in the logo is [Varela Round](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Varela+Round). The fonts in the program are "System" and [Inconsolata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata). Tools used to make this project include the Eclipse IDE, SceneBuilder, VSCode, and ANTLR. Also, this is my first time using javafx to make a GUI (I had previously used Swing). For learning purposes, resources like this official [tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javase-clienttechnologies.htm) and [CSS reference guide](https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/scene/doc-files/cssref.html) are useful, as well as other API documents.
